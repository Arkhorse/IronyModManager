### Notes
**OSX:**
Extract the .7z file to a location you want Irony installed to. Open Terminal.app and cd to the directory you installed to. Run ```chmod +x IronyModManager```. That will allow you to execute the app. Then you can either start the app in Terminal.app with the command ```./IronyModManger``` (the ./ are important!) or double-click the file in Finder.

**Linux:**
Extract the 7z file somewhere that you'd like to have Irony installed. Navigate to the folder where you extracted Irony and run the ```chmod +x IronyModManager``` command. That will allow you to execute the app. Finally you can run the app using the ```./IronyModManager``` command.
