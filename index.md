### Notes
Feedback on how Irony performs on OSX\Linux would be welcome. Just open a new issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bcssov/IronyModManager/issues) and I'm sure we can sort something out to ensure max compatibility with these operating systems in case something does not work as expected.

* OSX is untested and should be considered experimental (I have no testers and no machine to test on).
* Linux x64 was briefly tested and should be considered experimental (incase the Stellaris folder is not detected check the Wiki FAQ).
