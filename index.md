Irony Mod Manager is a new mod manager for Paradox Games which at the moment supports Stellaris only but at a later date support for additional games will be added. The games which will be supported are the ones which support the newest Paradox Launcher.

### Download
* Latest stable version: [v1.3.48](https://github.com/bcssov/IronyModManager/releases/tag/v1.3.48).

### Important Notice about Paradox Launcher 2020.10
This update broke custom mod managers since it added play-styles (collections in Irony). A newer Irony update (1.4) will be compatible with it (once I can get the Paradox Launcher to update to 2020.10 version for me to analyze the structure). 

For the time being you can do the following:

- Open the options popup in Irony 
- Point Irony towards the Stellaris executable 
- Use Launch Game option from within Irony to launch the game. 

NOTE: If you ever re-open the paradox launcher **remember** to **reapply** the collection in Irony since it will overwrite settings that Irony has set.
