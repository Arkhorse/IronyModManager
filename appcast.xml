			<description>RELEASE INFO
* Irony will no longer crash upon encountering invalid localization items with wrong quote types being used but will flag these as invalid

CHANGES FROM v1.9:
* Upgrade dependencies
* Tweak basic conflict solver merge view
* Add advanced merge "view" by allowing you to open diffs in external editor of your choice
* Improve version sort
* Clear selection upon mod sort
* Fix mod compare sort scroll
* Improved localization conflict detection and export (warning this is not backwards compatible and could reset a lot of resolved conflicts)
* Allow ignore use to ignore partial definition name matches
* Custom patches overriding existing mod files will be acknowledged by Irony and replaced during replacement phase and used instead of the source mod file</description>
