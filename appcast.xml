			<description>NOTE:
Auto update was broken by an external component or GitHub breaking change which is outside of my control. If an update fails please update manually to at least v1.11.30 which fixes this problem.

RELEASE INFO:
* Fix potential mod parser issue in dealing with quote marks
* Hash report export takes into account patch enabled flag
* Ensure that hash report takes into account missing descriptor for patch mod before attempting to include it in the report

CHANGES FROM v1.11:
* Update dependencies
* Various minor fixes
* Add Spanish translation (by Werety)
* Removed advanced mod merge (use compress instead)
* German localization changes (by Cranky)
* Added periodic permission check which verifies whether Irony is blocked by AV
* Added DLC Manager
* Fix issue in certain cases where Irony autofix caused game items to not show due to dependency load cycle (this is a breaking change)
* Round up numeric values in script values to allow Irony for even greater precision when comparing definition code (this is a breaking change)
* Irony patch mod control added (ability to disable it, ability to delete it)
* Wrap certain IO functions into retry strategy to hopefully prevent any CTDs (in cases where a file is locked)
* Image preview fixes and improvements
* Image preview should now show dds cubemaps properly
* Add keyboard shortcuts
* Reduce conflict solver memory usage (in testing ~300 mods in v1.11 used ~5.2GB of memory and v1.12 ~2.8GB)
* Show notification if Irony cannot import a certain mod in a collection
* Add command line support (to be utilized by projects like pdx unlimiter)
* Expand patch refresh evaluation to take into account load order and other variables to more accurately notify users that conflict solver needs a re-run
