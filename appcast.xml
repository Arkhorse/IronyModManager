Auto update was broken by an external component or GitHub breaking change which is outside of my control. If an update fails please update manually to at least v1.11.30 which fixes this problem.

RELEASE INFO:

CHANGES FROM v1.11:
* Update dependencies
* Various minor fixes
* Add Spanish translation (by Werety)
* Removed advanced mod merge (use compress instead)
* German localization changes (by Cranky)
* Added periodic permission check which verifies whether Irony is blocked by AV
* Added DLC Manager
* Fix issue in certain cases where Irony autofix caused game items to not show due to dependency load cycle (this is a breaking change)
* Round up numeric values in script values to allow Irony for even greater precision when comparing definition code (this is a breaking change)

* Wrap certain IO functions into retry strategy to hopefully prevent any CTDs (in cases where a file is locked)
* Image preview fixes and improvements
