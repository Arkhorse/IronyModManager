			<title>1.10.58</title>
			<description>This is an urgent hotfix as the most recent update inadvertently broke file dialogs.

RELEASE INFO
* Ensure the certain mod area context menu actions are always visible
* Optimize context menus
* Add support for more DDS preview types

CHANGES FROM v1.9:

* Tweak basic conflict solver merge view
* Add advanced merge "view" by allowing you to open diffs in external editor of your choice
* Improve version sort
* Clear selection upon mod sort
* Fix mod compare sort scroll
