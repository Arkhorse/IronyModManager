			<title>1.9.55</title>
			<description>RELEASE INFO:
* Attempt to fix the fact that the game will sometimes delete local zipped mod descriptors by locking said descriptors using readonly flag
* Thread compress merge (limit to 4 threads max)
* Fix some minor mod merge progress calculation bugs
* Descriptor refresh now retains mod descriptor lock state

CHANGES FROM v1.8:
* Upgrade to net5
* Upgrade dependencies
* Fix conflict solver UI issue with conflict solver dropdown menu opening on the wrong screen (more like Avalonia hack fix)
* Add new merge type called compress which zips all mod files into local mod directory
* Add option to remove merged mods (for all types unless these mods folders have been renamed)</description>
