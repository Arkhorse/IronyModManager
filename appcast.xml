* German localization changes (by Cranky)
* Added periodic permission check which verifies whether Irony is blocked by AV
* Added DLC Manager
* Fix issue in certain cases where Irony autofix caused game items to not show due to dependency load cycle (this is a breaking change)
* Round up numeric values in script values to allow Irony for even greater precision when comparing definition code (this is a breaking change)
* Irony patch mod control added (ability to disable it, ability to delete it)
* Wrap certain IO functions into retry strategy to hopefully prevent any CTDs (in cases where a file is locked)
* Image preview fixes and improvements
* Image preview should now show dds cubemaps properly
* Add keyboard shortcuts
* Reduce conflict solver memory usage (in testing ~300 mods in v1.11 used ~5.2GB of memory and v1.12 ~2.8GB)
* Show notification if Irony cannot import a certain mod in a collection
* Add command line support (to be utilized by projects like pdx unlimiter)
* Expand patch refresh evaluation to take into account load order and other variables to more accurately notify users that conflict solver needs a re-run
* Refresh mod list before performing a collection import
* Tweak moving around mods in collection mods area
