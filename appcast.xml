* German localization changes (by Cranky)
* Added periodic permission check which verifies whether Irony is blocked by AV
* Added DLC Manager
* Fix issue in certain cases where Irony autofix caused game items to not show due to dependency load cycle (this is a breaking change)

* Wrap certain IO functions into retry strategy to hopefully prevent any CTDs (in cases where a file is locked)
* Image preview fixes and improvements
